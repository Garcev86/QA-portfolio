—-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Improvement:

Current: When the desired card is opened, there are two scroll bars, it is necessary to scroll several times to display the entire content of the card while moving the first scroll bar and then the second.

Requested: Place only one scroll bar that can be used to list the entire card content.

Reason: Most websites follow this convention, users are familiar with a single vertical scroll bar, and it is easier to view the entire content of the card.


—-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improvement:

Current: Currently only the light background theme is on the website.

Requested: Inserting the button on every page to choose a background theme from light to dark and vice versa.

Reason: Many users find dark themes sleek and visually appealing, dark themes are less taxing on the eyes, especially in low-light conditions, also they reduce glare and prevent excessive brightness.


—---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Improvement:

Current: On the Main page in the logout container there is no setting option for set and updating the user profile.

Requested: Creating a settings option in the logout container with options to fill in and update the user profile.

Reason: Some users want to update their profile with basic information and their professional image.

—---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


Improvement:

Current: The button to close the card is located on the card itself in the upper right corner and is not very visible because of the background color image of the benefit card.

Requested: Change the position of the close card button at the very top of the open card.

Reason: The user can more easily recognize the close button on the opened card.


—----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Improvement:

Current: The subscribe and redeem buttons remain unchanged when hovering over and clicking on them to select a specific benefit card.

Requested:  Add a blue color to the subscribe and redeem buttons when the buttons hover and are clicked.

Reason: Users receive immediate feedback that their click was registered, and dynamic changes (color shift) make the interface more engaging.


—----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Improvement:

Current: The font size of the content on the card headline is 18px, the category tag is 11px, the Rating is 12px, and the button label is 14px.

Requested: Change the font size of the content on the card headline to change to 24px, the category tag to change to 14px, the rating to change to 14px, and the button label to change to 16px.

Reason: Maintaining balanced font sizes and avoiding using too small fonts are better for good card content, content readability is defined by the selected font and applied font sizes, and the card becomes visually balanced and nicer for the human eye.


—----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Improvement: 

Current: The search and filter box is located on the right side of the page and cannot be closed or moved to the right side.

Requested: Creating the button in a circle with an icon in the center that flips 180 degrees depending on whether the side nav is toggled open/closed (i.e. from a left arrow to a right arrow).

Reason: Toggle (open/close) side panel frees up screen space and you can put more cards, Users can choose to (open/close) the panel based on their preference, allowing users to focus on the main content area.
